                        Impressionism was a French artistic trend with emphasis on painting 
                        emphasis in painting that occurred at the time of the so-called "Belle Époque" (1871-1914).
                        This trend played a very important role in the renewal of 20th century art. 
                        of 20th century art, being the great propeller of the so-called European avant-garde.
                        The term "Impressionism" comes from a criticism of a work by Claude Monet, 
                        "Impression, Sunrise", from 1872.

                The painters of Impressionist art used to produce their canvases in the open air. 
                The intention was to capture the shades that objects reflect according to the 
                the sunlight at certain times of the day.
                This movement was a watershed for painting. 
                Its artists were not bound to the teachings of academic realism.
                However, they were influenced by the positivist currents of the second half of the 
                of the second half of the 19th century, which excelled in precision and realism.
                This new artistic style competed with academic productions. To this end,
                 There were places outside the traditional art circuits, such as the Salons, 
                 where impressionist painters held exhibitions showing their paintings.
                It is worth mentioning that the impressionist aesthetic guidelines are present in graphic 
                graphic productions, in advertising, and other forms of mass communication. 
                Up to the present day they continue to influence new aesthetics.

                        Impression, Sunrise (1872–1872) - <b>Claude Monet</b>
                        <br> <br>
                        Claude Monet was a French Impressionist painter, considered one of the most important artists of Impressionism.

                        The term "Impressionism" came about because of his 1872 work "Impression, Sunrise".

                        This is because at the First Impressionist Exhibition held in 1874 in Paris, the group of artists was pejoratively called "impressionists" by the critics.
                        Among his main works are:
