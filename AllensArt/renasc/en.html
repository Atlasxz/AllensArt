                        The Artistic Renaissance represented one of the branches of the 
                        of the Renaissance period with the profusion of several works.
                        Remember that the Renaissance was an artistic 
                        intellectual and cultural movement that began in the 15th century in Italy.
                        It was with the decline of the feudal system and of several characteristics 
                        associated with the medieval period, that the Renaissance emerged, 
                        a period of cultural, artistic and scientific effervescence that spread 
                        that spread throughout Europe.

                Unlike medieval art, the artistic renaissance was inspired by classical antiquity, that is, the Greco-Roman arts, which had been forgotten for centuries.
                For Renaissance artists, the context associated with the medieval period made it impossible for art to evolve in many ways.
                This is because the medieval period was closely related to a religious culture, where theocentrism (God in the center of the universe) ruled people's lives.
                It was from the scientific, social, and cultural advance that the Renaissance movement arose, which was marked above all by its humanistic character.
                Thus, medieval theocentrism gave way to Renaissance anthropocentrism, with the arrival of the Modern Age.
                <br><br>
                The great contribution of Renaissance art was the discovery of perspective and depth. Thus, from the straight and two-dimensional plane of medieval art, Renaissance art promoted a different look.
                Other no less important aspects explored by Renaissance artists were the balance of forms and the search for harmony, based on classical art.
                It is worth remembering that the artistic renaissance included the evolution of painting, sculpture, architecture, and literature, valuing human and natural aspects.
                Although many themes explored by Renaissance artists were associated with the religious and spiritual realm, the change in mentality of the time made it possible to include a variety of themes. Subjects ranged from customs, mythology, and landscapes, among others.
